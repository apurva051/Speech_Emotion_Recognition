# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
Speech is the fundamental strategy for us to communicate with each other. However, emotions play a vital role in communication. It is a medium of expression of oneâ€™s perspective to others. It includes several emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness, fear, passion, disgust, etc. It has been a topic of research for a long time but it is a challenging task to perform as human emotions are very subjective and sometimes it is even harder for humans to notate them. The main aim of this project is to classify the emotional state of the speaker from the speech signal. In this, we will be making SER (Speech Emotion Recognition) which identifies speech signals to detect the emotions underlying them. In particular, we will be creating a classification model elicited by speeches based on Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms ie. (MLP classification, CNN classifiers, SVM) by analyzing the acoustic features.
